# Getting Started

This guide is based on Raspberry Pi 5 8GB RAM with a 256GB SSD M.2 NVME PCie.

Usually, people will recommend use a MicroSD with Raspberry Pi (starting from this point, I'm gonna refer to it as Raspi) and install the OS into it, however, if you want to use MircoSD, you will also need to purchase a MicroSD reader.

Since I can't think of much cases where I can get benefit from owning a reader, I refused to purchase one. And as a consequence to that, I will also install the OS into my SSD, this is not recommend as it will cause the SSD degradate faster due to many I/O operations.

Beside that, I want to connect to my Raspi via network only, hence no other addition purchases such as micro HDMI are needed.

Since I have a USB already, I will utilized it as a secondary OS. Hence the progress to install the primary OS on the SSD will add a few steps than necessary.
